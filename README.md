Below is a code snippet designed for a Dam Water Level Monitoring System compatible with NodeMCU 1.0 and ThingSpeak platform. Prior to uploading this code onto NodeMCU, it's essential to update the WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak data fields within the code to ensure seamless functionality.

Key points about the code:
In this script:

- Utilizing the ESP8266WiFi library, tailored for ESP8266-specific WiFi functions, we establish network connectivity.
- The `const char* ssid` denotes the WiFi network's SSID (name) to connect to.
- The `const char* password` function manages password authentication for the network.
- Pin assignments for LEDs, buzzer, and ultrasonic sensor trigger and echo pins are specified.
- `Serial.begin(115200)` sets up communication with the serial monitor at a baud rate of 115200 bits per second.
- `WiFi.begin` initializes WiFi library network settings and checks the current status.
- `WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED` indicates successful connection to the WiFi network.
- `Server.begin` commences listening for incoming connections.
- Within the `void loop`, functions like `measure()` handle measurement details, and `internet()` updates water depth data to ThingSpeak.
- `digitalWrite()` controls the digital pin's voltage to either HIGH (3.3V) or LOW (0V) based on its output configuration.
- "Client disconnected" signifies a client initiated a request but disconnected before reading all responses.

This code facilitates real-time monitoring of dam water levels, ensuring timely action in case of fluctuations or emergencies.
